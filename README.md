A huge thank you to [BottlecapDave](https://github.com/BottlecapDave) and the excellent [Home Assistant Octopus Energy Integration](https://github.com/BottlecapDave/HomeAssistant-OctopusEnergy) project.

This integration is heavily inspired by, and partially based upon, that integration. Their work provided a strong reference for architecture, implementation patterns, and Home Assistant energy ecosystem support.
